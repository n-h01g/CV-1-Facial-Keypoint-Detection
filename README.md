### Project Details

In this project, I: 
- loaded, prepped and visualised the Facial Keypoint dataset;
- defined the data transform for training and test data;
- defined and trained a Convolutional Neural Network to predict facial keypoints;
- defined the loss and optimization functions to be optimal for facial keypoint detection;
- used Haar Cascades, as well as the trained CNN model, for facial keypoint detection in random images; and
- inspected predictions and tested validity of model.
